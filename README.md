Elsdorf is a little town in the west part of Germany, near Cologne. The whole area is one of the largest lignite districts in Europe and the most 
important source of lignite within the country (95 Mt production/a). The study area is located near the former lignite mine of Bergheim, where the
recultivation of the terrain was implemented, and finally completed in 2012 (Henselowsky et al., 2021).
This particular area was chosen due to its history in which human has changed the the landuse not only through mining activities, but later in other
relevant different ways as well. The main aim of this project is the masking of regions where land is being used in satellite images obtained through
Landsat which have a low spatial resolution.
